# SDCND_1stProject_LaneDetection
Project: Lane detection from the input scenario (Video)

Overview: 
In this project I have used canny edge detection algorithm and hough transform to detect the lane from the video stream (solidYellowLeft.mp4 and solidWhiteRight.mp4) as given in the project folder 


I have included the following files in this project folder:

 1. LaneDetection_solidWhiteRight_Project1.ipynb (script is written in jupyter notebook, which uses the kernel python 3 and input-'solidWhiteRight.mp4')
 2. LaneDetection_solidYellowLeft_Project1.ipynb (script is written in jupyter notebook, which uses the kernel python 3 and input-'solidYellowLeft.mp4')
 3. Project1_LaneDetection.pdf (brief write-up on the approach)
 4. solidWhiteRight.mp4
 5. solidWhiteRight_OutPut.mp4 (output video saved from LaneDetection_solidWhiteRight_Project1.ipynb)
 6. solidYellowLeft.mp4
 7. solidYellowLeft_OutPut.mp4 (output video saved from LaneDetection_solidYellowLeft_Project1.ipynb)

#Note: The script works in Python3.6.1
