# SDCND_1stProject_LaneDetection
Project: Lane detection from the input scenario (Video)

Overview: 
In this project I have used canny edge detection algorithm and hough transform to detect the lane from the video stream (solidYellowLeft.mp4 and solidWhiteRight.mp4) as given in the project folder 


I have included the following files in this project folder:

 1. LaneDetection_solidWhiteRight_Project1.ipynb (script is written in jupyter notebook, which uses the kernel python 3 and input is solidWhiteRight.mp4)
 2. LaneDetection_solidWhiteRight_Project1.html (Downloaded as html from 'LaneDetection_solidWhiteRight_Project1.ipynb')
 3. LaneDetection_solidYellowLeft_Project1.ipynb (script is written in jupyter notebook, which uses the kernel python 3 and input is solidYellowLeft.mp4)
 4. LaneDetection_solidYellowLeft_Project1.html (Downloaded as html from 'LaneDetection_solidYellowLeft_Project1.ipynb')
 5. ScreenShot_JupyterNotebook_Output_solidWhiteRight_1stProject.JPG (screenshot is captured while running the script in jupyter notebook)
 6. ScreenShot_JupyterNotebook_Output_SolidYellowLeft_1stProject.JPG (screenshot is captured while running the script in jupyter notebook)
 7. Project1_LaneDetection.pdf (brief write-up on the approach)
 8. solidWhiteRight.mp4
 9. solidYellowLeft.mp4

#Note: The script works in Python3.6.1
