# SDCND_1stProject_LaneDetection
Project: Lane detection from the input scenario (Video)

Overview: 
In this project I have used canny edge detection algorithm and hough transform to detect the lane from the video stream (solidYellowLeft.mp4 
and solidWhiteRight.mp4) as given in the project folder 

I have included the following files in this project folder
- LaneDetection_Project1.ipynb
- LaneDetection_Project1.html
- Project1_LaneDetection.pdf (brief write-up on the approach)
